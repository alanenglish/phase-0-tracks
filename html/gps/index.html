<!--I changed the content of my file and made it about puppies so that it made a little more sense. The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to give them meaning, rather than a <div> tag that doesn't explain what it is. To me, the <form>, <table>, <nav>, <header> and <footer> are very useful. From my research, the web browser displays the HTML elements from Top to Bottom. We learned how to create a new sublime snippet, which seems very useful. I think I will create more when I get a better idea of what shortcuts would be useful to me. But they seem like a really good way to save time and keep your file organized. I think the Release 2 was most difficult, as we were introduced to a few semantic elements that aren't quite as obvious as others as to their meaning, such as aside. I still get a little confused when to use each element, there are so many it'll take some time and practice getting it down. I can improve by reading reference guides and getting a better understanding of the most commonly used elements. -->
