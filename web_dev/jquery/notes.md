I plan to look at various resources online, including the official jQuery documentation. I like to read up on material, and then test it out often to gain a better comprehension of it. I think taking breaks is important, especially when learning a new topic - there are tendencies to get caught venturing down a rabbit hole, which I don't want to do (at least right now). I may come back to Codecademy and do the JQuery course at some point before Phase 1, if I have time. Otherwise, I will try to implement what I have already learned throughout Phase 0 and translate that to JQuery.
