# Git Definitions Mention Glenna!!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version Control is a tool which allows the user to track progress, review and revert file changes, see who modified something and when, create backups, etc. It is useful because branching and merging allows multiple people to be working on and making changes to a file, without running the risk of overwriting the master file. If things get screwed up or files get lost, you can recover/revert back to a previous version. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch is essentially a copy of your project. A user would create a branch to explore some possible changes to a file that could eventually be merged into the master, or discarded if the user didn't like the result. Branching allows team members to work concurrently.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    A commit is essentially a save point, used anytime you've made some changes, the user lets Git know which file/s they would like to create a save point for using the commit command. A good commit message is a detailed description of exactly what changes were made to the file/s.
* What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict exists when a current branch and the branch a user wants to merge into the current branch have diverged - your commits aren't lining up in the two branches.
