Real-Life Algorithm - Morning Dog Walk/Coffee Run

- When the local time is between 7:00am and 9:00am, Alan needs a coffee and Harper needs a walk.

- Make sure Harper has eaten breakfast so he has enough fuel for his walk:

		- If Harper begins to eat out of his bowl on his own like a normal dog, its your lucky day.
		- If Harper acts very confused like he has never eaten a meal before:
			- Sit down next to his bowl to make him feel comfortable, if he is willing to eat now, proceed to harness preparation when finished - if not, proceed to next step,
			- Sprinkle some food on the ground in front of his bowl, if he will compromise on eating this way, proceed to harness preparation when finished - if not, proceed to next step,
			- Grab a handful of food and attempt to have him eat out of your hand, if this does the trick, proceed to harness preparation when finished - if not, proceed to next step,
			- Try to feed two pellets at a time straight to mouth from top of thumb and index finger, if this is his preferred method of eating today proceed to harness preparation when finished - if not, proceed to next step,
